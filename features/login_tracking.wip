Feature: Login tracking
  In order to assist in troubleshooting issues
  As a system administrator
  I should be able to view tracked information about user access

  sign_in_count - Increased every time a sign in is made
  current_sign_in_at - A timestamp updated when the user signs in
  last_sign_in_at - Holds the timestamp of the previous sign in
  current_sign_in_ip - The remote ip updated when the user sign in
  last_sign_in_ip - Holds the remote ip of the previous sign in

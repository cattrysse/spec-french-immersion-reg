Feature: Session timeout
  In order to balance the convenience of "Remember me" with system security
  As a user
  My session should expire after some period of time

  When a session expires after the configured time, the user will be logged out and asked for credentials again.
  To facilitate this, the user will be redirected to the sign in page in a logged-out state.
